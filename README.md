#  Customer Segmentation Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify customers into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** spending categories based on their **age** and **annual income**. It demonstrates how supervised machine learning can help businesses understand customer profiles and guide marketing strategies.
